# A void function with three parameters: the nested list of meteor positions, the size of the meteors, and the width of the game screen. The meteors should be placed at
the top of the screen (y position fixed at zero) at random positions along the width of the screen
(x positions random, but meteors can’t overlap each other). Each time a meteor is placed, its
location should be appended to the list of meteor positions. Finally, meteors should fall at random times. You should consider using the random() and randint() or randrange()
functions in the random module when coding this function. Note that this function doesn’t
actually drop the meteors, but it positions meteors along the top of the game screen so they
can fall when their positions are updated by update meteor position(). However, to
code this function correctly, you have to think of them falling at random times and at random
positions along the x-axis. Otherwise, you’ll end up with a sheet of meteors falling at all times.
Remember that the game screen is updated about 30 times per second which is fast!
