# A non-void function with four parameters: the position (a list) of
the player, the position (a list) of the meteor, the size of the player, and the size of the meteor.
This function is called by collision check() and returns True if the meteor has hit the
player or False if it hasnâ€™t. Think carefully about how to check to determine whether or not
the meteor has hit the player. Drawing some sketches will help. Note that the positions of the
meteor and the player are measured from their top left corners (0,0). Note also that this
function considers one meteor at a time; it only takes one meteor hitting the player for the
player to die.
