# A non-void function with four parameters: the nested list of meteor
# positions, the position (a list) of the player, the size of the player, and the size of a meteor. This
# function calls detect collision() for each meteor, and if (and as soon as) a collision is
# detected, it returns True to main(). Otherwise, it returns False and the game continues.
