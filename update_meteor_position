# A non-void function with four parameters: the nested list
# of meteor positions, the height of the game screen, the score, and the speed of the meteors; it
# returns the integer score. For each meteor still in play, its y position should be increased by
# the meteor speed (pixels moved). Each meteor hitting the ground should be removed from the
# nested list and the userâ€™s score increased by one. Note that a meteor is either still in play or it
# has hit the ground.

  for each_meteor in screen:
    y_position += 1
  if y_position == (800, 600):
    met_list.remove(meteor)
    score += 1
