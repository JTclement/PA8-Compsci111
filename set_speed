# A non-void function with one parameter, an integer score, which returns the
speed. The speed should be based on the score: the higher the score, the faster the speed should
be. However, don’t set the speed to the score! Initially the score is zero, and if the speed is zero,
the meteors won’t fall. Also, the speed is the number of pixels that each meteor “falls” at each
update (updates occur about 30 times per second!), so if you set the speed to the score later, the
meteor will move too fast for you to see it.
